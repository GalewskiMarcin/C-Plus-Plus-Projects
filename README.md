Hi GitHub
I have just created my first repository and branch. Soon I'll try to be a good programmer. Now I have to learn GIT and GIT HUB and how to use them.  In the future I'd like to know what is project patterns. Ok, I have to end it, because time's running out and I can't program  vell yet. 
Cya !
